# HuffmanCodingVenkiboo
Huffman Coding Project in JAVA

Open the project in your Java IDE.

Usage
Run the HuffmanCodingProject class to compress a text file.
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the name of the text file to be compressed.
The program will generate a compressed file named secretoutput.huf.
To decode the compressed file, run the Decoding class. The decoded text will be saved in a file named DecodedFile.txt.

Efficiency Calculation
The project includes an efficiency calculation feature. After encoding the text, it provides information about the compression efficiency, including original file size, compressed file size, Huffman table size, and the overall compression efficiency.
To view the efficiency calculation, run the HuffmanCodingProject and choose the option for decoding (press 'y'). The efficiency information will be displayed after decoding.

File Structure
HuffmanCodingProject.java: Main class for encoding and decoding.
Encoding.java: Class for text compression (Huffman encoding).
Decoding.java: Class for text decompression (Huffman decoding).
BitOutputStream.java: Custom class for writing compressed bits to a file.
BitInputStream.java: Custom class for reading bits from a file.
Other source files (Huffman tree, frequency comparison, etc.).
